**Mapping My Daily Music Rhythms**  
Exploring what I listen to and when, using my Spotify history to uncover patterns in mood, energy, and daily routines.

## Motivation
Music shapes daily life. Circadiana tracks my personal listening habits to see how my music choices vary across hours, days, and moods, combining data science with behavioural insights.

3. Analyze patterns by hour/day and audio features  
4. Visualize trends (heatmaps, line plots, circular plots)  
5. Extract insights & potential predictions
